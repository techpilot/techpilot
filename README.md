ABOUT ME

I am Stephen Ngwu, a Software Developer. Lover of all things Opensource, Linux, Web and Computer Vision. I've been coding for few years now. As a developer I've worked on personal projects to help build my career. I've gotten learned the skills that are required to succeed in the real-world. I'm actively looking for any good opportunity to implement all I have learnt, grow, and to gain experience.
